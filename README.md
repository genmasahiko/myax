# My Analysis programs

This is a test source code for QuantumESPRESSO pre-/post-processing.<br>
As this program is for personal use, **I do not accept any responsibility for any losses from using this program.** <br>

***

## Installation

Use `make` in the directory `src`. <br>
Since I don't consider compiler dependence, you should revise `Makefile`. <br>
